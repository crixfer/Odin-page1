# Odin-page1
This is my first page created during The Odin Project course.
In this page, I have put into practice the use of Flexbox to align most of the things that
needed to be centered, on one specific side or another.

I also used the root in CSS to add the color palette that I used, making it easier for me to follow
the required color.

This practice gave me a better understanding of how to align and how to use the divs in a 
proper and more useful way.
